How to create a VPC? this guide will explain how to create a VPC in AWS! [network isolation]

1- Two VPCs can compute with each using VPC Peering/ Transit gateway

This example will be deploying 2 public 2 private subnets
2 Subnets, 1 public 1 private in one AZ model

VPC CIDR : 10.0.0.0/16

Public Subnets: 10.0.1.0/24 10.0.2.0/24
Private Subnets: 10.0.3.0/24 10.0.4.0/24

STEP:1 Create VPC with the CIDR block
** WHEN VPC created using AWS console, these created by default
1- Route table created
2- Network ACL created (subnet level firewall routing)
3- Security group created (instance level firewall routing)

Need to create:
1- Subnets 
2- Internet gateway
3- Custom route table 


STEP:2 Create Subnets with the CIDR blocks decided earlier
1- Modify auto assign public ip for these subnets


STEP:3 Attach Internet gateway to public subnets to make route traffic from subnets to internet
1- Create IGW
2- Attach to the VPC created earlier

STEP:3 By default route table routes requests locally (within the VPC)
1- Createa  new "public route table"
2- edit it's routes, to 0.0.0.0/0 and add target to internet with the IGW created earlier
3- By default all subnets are associated with the default (no internet one) route table
4- now associate the public subents to the public route table created in this step


** Basically, now if you launch an EC2 in the private subnets, it can only be connected through a server in public subnet
